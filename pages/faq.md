# _FAQ_

**Can I submit old class papers to _The Dialectic_?**

Yes, _The Dialectic_ accepts class papers, so long as they arenâ€™t already published. Please bear in mind that class papers may need to be edited before submission in order to more closely align with our theme for the semester. Please also note that we expect our papers to be accessible to readers with no background expertise, so papers may be modified for readability.  

**Does _The Dialectic_ print its issues?**

At the moment, _The Dialectic_ only publishes online. When more students are permitted on campus, we may begin producing print issues. 

**How can I get involved in the editing and publication of the papers?**

_The Dialectic_ is always looking for new editors. Interested individuals should contact us at theamherstdialectic@gmail.com. Due to logistical limitations, only current students at Amherst College may apply to be editors.
