# _Submission Guidelines_

* Our focus is on papers with methods rooted in history or political science, but other related subjects will be accepted at our discretion if they illuminate a particularly intriguing or relevant element of our theme. Please note that all papers must be accessible to an audience with little training in the subject. 
* We recommend that the paper be within a range of 10 to 30 double-spaced pages, but flexibility is permitted at our discretion.
* Citations should be in Chicago style, with footnotes instead of endnotes.
* Please submit files via Google Drive or through email at theamherstdialectic@gmail.com  in a word document.
* Papers need not adhere strictly to the academic style of writing. Creativity is encouraged so long as it doesn’t interfere with clarity. Feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions regarding what might be permissible. 
* The due date for submissions is October 31st 2020. We’re aiming for publication in early December.
