# _The Dialectic_

**This is the test page for this site. Let's hope it works.**

## Who Are We?

The Amherst Dialectic is Amherst College’s newest and most interdisciplinary academic journal. At The Dialectic, we strive to explore the roots of pressing issues facing contemporary society, with a particular focus on political and historical inquiry.

We devote each of our semesterly issues to discussing a general theme relevant to the world today. Each of our student authors — chosen from a variety of schools and disciplines around the country — will use their own skills and academic specialities to grapple with the questions and ideas present in that theme and in its modern context. To further discuss the theme, we will include interviews of relevant professors and book reviews by the editors in each issue. 

Central to our philosophy is that no one discipline holds the keys to fully understanding an issue. Only through dialogue and shared study can we produce meaningful answers to our questions. We hope that as you read these carefully selected and edited papers, you bear in mind not just what each discipline studies, but what it can tell you about the big questions of our world.
