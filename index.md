# _The Dialectic_

## Who Are We?

_The Amherst Dialectic_ is Amherst College’s newest interdisciplinary academic journal. At _The Dialectic_, we strive to explore the roots of pressing issues facing contemporary society, with a particular focus on political and historical inquiry.

*We are currently searching for editors and contributors for our first issue, to be published tentatively in December 2020. Email amherstdialectic@gmail.com if interested.*

## This Semester's Topic: _"Catastrophe"_

Catastrophes are sudden. At any given time, they can come about with calamitous force and bring about a wave of disruption that can last from moments to years. But their suddenness doesn’t mean that they must remain mysteries under an analytical gaze. Rather, these catastrophes are often emblematic of underlying societal mechanisms and pathologies, both in how they arise and in how we react. They reveal truths about our systems and institutions by showing us the extreme.

To many people, we are currently living in the midst of a catastrophe. Its exact nature is up for debate, and it certainly has many facets — the coronavirus pandemic, civil unrest over police brutality, mass unemployment — but if nothing else, it is true that we’ve transitioned to a new normal. 

Examining catastrophes forces us to confront cutting questions. What can catastrophes past and present reveal about the state of our society? Do catastrophes come from bad luck and misfortune, or do they require pre-existing conditions? What makes catastrophes so physically and psychologically damaging? How can society prepare for and cope with events that are, by their very nature, unpredictable and disruptive?  And finally, what avenues for positive change can a catastrophe open? 

These questions don’t have easy answers, but with the combined work of numerous gifted writers and researchers from across the country, we hope to provide insight into the nature of catastrophes past and present.
