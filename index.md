# _The Dialectic_


## Who Are We?

The Amherst Dialectic is Amherst College’s newest and most interdisciplinary academic journal. At The Dialectic, we strive to explore the roots of pressing issues facing contemporary society, with a particular focus on political and historical inquiry.

We devote each of our semesterly issues to discussing a general theme relevant to the world today. Each of our student authors — chosen from a variety of schools and disciplines around the country — will use their own skills and academic specialities to grapple with the questions and ideas present in that theme and in its modern context. To further discuss the theme, we will include interviews of relevant professors and book reviews by the editors in each issue. 

Central to our philosophy is that no one discipline holds the keys to fully understanding an issue. Only through dialogue and shared study can we produce meaningful answers to our questions. We hope that as you read these carefully selected and edited papers, you bear in mind not just what each discipline studies, but what it can tell you about the big questions of our world. 

## _This Semester's Topic:_
## _Catastrophe_

Catastrophes are sudden. At any given time, they can come about with calamitous force and bring about a wave of disruption that can last from moments to years. But their suddenness doesn’t mean that they must remain mysteries under an analytical gaze. Rather, these catastrophes are often emblematic of underlying societal mechanisms and pathologies, both in how they arise and in how we react. They reveal truths about our systems and institutions by showing us the extreme.

To many people, we are currently living in the midst of a catastrophe. Its exact nature is up for debate, and it certainly has many facets — the coronavirus pandemic, civil unrest over police brutality, mass unemployment — but if nothing else, it is true that we’ve transitioned to a new normal. Under these new standards, we find it topical to ask: What can catastrophes past and present reveal about the state of our society? Do catastrophes come from bad luck and misfortune, or do they require pre-existing conditions? What makes catastrophes so physically and psychologically damaging? How can society prepare for and cope with events that are, by their very nature, unpredictable and disruptive?  And finally, what avenues for positive change can a catastrophe open? 

These questions don’t have easy answers, but with the combined work of numerous gifted writers and researchers from around the country, we hope to provide insight into the nature of catastrophe, both in the past, and in the present.
